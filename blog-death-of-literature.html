            </header>
            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Throughout the 20th century, critics repeatedly declared literature dead or dying—ironically the same century that produced Vonnegut, Hemingway, Pynchon, and Wallace. In 2025, literature faces similar obituaries.</p>
                <p>While opinions vary on whether the medium is still breathing or experiencing cadaveric spasms, the conclusion remains the same: young people, with their <em>(INSERT CONDESCENDING REASON HERE)</em>, just aren’t interested in reading anymore.</p>
                <p>Alex Schuh’s article “The Death of Reading is on the Horizon. Should We Care?” makes you want to pull out your Boomer Bingo Card. Mr. Schuh cites declining reading scores, blames digital education models and COVID-19, and warns that shrinking attention spans threaten our ability to reason through complex problems.</p>
                <p>Scratch the (very thin) surface of this, and the many other, apparently measured arguments and you’ll find they reach the same conclusion: young people, with their phone-fried brains and dopamine addiction, are just too stupid to read. Every one of these articles carries that off-putting aftertaste of elitism and jadedness.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><strong>And yet… Gen Z readers have become major consumers of written fiction.</strong> According to the American Library Association’s 2022 survey, US Gen Z readers buy an average of 2 print books per month. Notably, the younger they are, the more print books they purchase.</p>
                <p>Overall, the global book market is projected to grow to $156.04 billion by 2030. The US publishing industry achieved record revenue of $32.5 billion in 2024, while independent publishers now account for 40% of all commercially available books.</p>
                <p>So what gives? Maybe we can find a clue in what the 20th-century doomsayers used as evidence for their claims that literature was about to kick it: Nihilism, new technologies, and shorter attention spans. But there was one claim that particularly interested me: <strong>thematic exhaustion.</strong></p>
                <p>It got me thinking. Gen Z is buying more books, reading more, writing more, and yet we still get establishment authors declaring the death of literature? How could that be?</p>
                <p>Well…it just so happens that older titles are absolutely <em>crushing</em> new releases. Backlist titles comprised about 50% of market volume in 2019. By 2022, that number was 70%, where it’s held steady through 2025. Major publishers now report backlist consistently making up 60–65% of consumer revenues.</p>
                <p>So maybe it’s not that younger readers aren’t interested in reading, but that they just aren’t interested in reading what’s put out nowadays. Maybe they’re just tired of reading yet another Game of Thrones clone, or God forbid saga, churned out by the millions annually.</p>
                <p>The current mood is one of exhaustion, not disinterest.</p>
                <blockquote>We as writers, as publishers, as creators are not entitled to people’s attention. We must earn it, and we must earn it by creating what’s worthy of it.</blockquote>
                <p>I believe we’re culturally on the precipice of the same feelings and conditions that gave rise to last century’s greats. A highly educated, cynical, and passionate generation that is desperate for something new, and when they can’t find it, they do it themselves.</p>
