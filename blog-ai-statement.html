                <p>We’ve been looking to put out a statement on AI for a while now. It’s a contentious topic in itself, but in the creative world, it’s become full-on trench warfare.</p>
                <p>Our statement is this: <strong>We not only don’t have an issue with the existence or usage of AI, but we welcome it.</strong> We believe that, when used right, it can be a revolutionary tool with tremendous benefits and that its (many) problems are inherent to the system in which it operates, not the software.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>The Practical Reality</h3>
                <p>AI is being used and will continue to be used. Even if you are devoutly anti-AI, almost certainly at some point an LLM was used in the products you consume daily. This pervasiveness means that “looking” for AI signs is pointless, especially in literature.</p>
                <p>However, the speed at which these “works” can be produced creates specific problems for magazines like ours. When we launched Faun by Moonlight, we were featured in an article titled <em>“5 Paying Literary Magazines to Submit to in October 2025.”</em> In about 24 hours, our inbox was flooded with hundreds of submissions.</p>
                <p>And in all of these submissions, a pervasive “style” kept reappearing—neat prose, a ton of adjectives, and formulaic structure. I’d venture that half of all submissions were likely AI-generated.</p>
                <p>This experience forced our hand. We implemented a submission fee (requiring the purchase of an issue). While not perfect, the strategy worked: the number of submissions dropped dramatically, while the quality increased substantially.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>The Ideological Stance</h3>
                <p>Ideologically, we believe AI to be a tool with unparalleled potential to benefit humanity, as long as its faults are addressed: <strong>overconsumption, overreliance, and theft.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Theft:</strong> Much of the knowledge AI possesses is obtained through unauthorized and unpaid use of copyrighted material. Artists MUST be compensated for the work stolen from them to train these models.</p>
                <p>However, there is something inherently socialist about the nature of AI. It has democratized access to knowledge. With AI, you have a chef, a book critic, a historian, and a proofreader at your fingertips, free and ready to use.</p>
                <blockquote>Ideally, we should nationalize these corporations and keep this software state-run with public access. But that’s a very long conversation for another time.</blockquote>
                <p>Ultimately, our goal is to explain to you, our writer, that if you have used AI to brainstorm, research, or edit your work, then we’d be happy to receive it. If you used it to generate it, then we are not.</p>
