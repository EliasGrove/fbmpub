                <p class="article-subtitle">Why we left X</p>
            </header>
            
            <div class="article-content">
                <p>The second reason we moved away from X (you know, besides all the fascism) is the environment that space has created, and the damage it is doing to Art as a medium of expression.</p>
                <p>Short-form content on social media inherently promotes the compression of complex topics into soundbites.</p>
                <p>Nuance, naturally, dies at the door when you're trying to explain any opinion in 250 characters.</p>
                <p>On Twitter this was always an issue, as it is on Bluesky, Mastodon, etc.</p>
                <p>Yet, since Elon's takeover of X, the short-form format has become less of a problem than the algorithm itself, which actively promotes outrage as the currency with which one buys an audience.</p>
                <p>Whereas before you risked being misunderstood, now misunderstanding has become the goal.</p>
                <p>The more outrageous, the less nuanced, the more polemic your tweet, the more engagement you will have.</p>
                <p>But now engagement pays--and it pays quite well.</p>
                <p>Creators know that if they strip away nuance, they increase the chance of "context collapse."</p>
                <p>Strangers will misunderstand the tweet, get mad, and reply. This triggers the algorithm to show the tweet to more strangers.</p>
                <p>Being clear reduces your reach and, by extension, how much you make.</p>
                <p>The popularity of these absolutist takes means users will naturally be forced to choose one position or another, without the benefit of a "middle ground" where opposing ideas may thrive.</p>
                <p>This, inversely, leads the users to lose their own sense of nuance, and their tolerance for it.</p>
                <p>This is how echo chambers are created, and curated.</p>
                
                

                <p>For the common user, this is damaging because it prevents them from engaging with different opinions, especially in politics, where extremist content has become more popular than ever.</p>
                <p>However, the environment it has festered in the creative community is particularly damaging to the medium.</p>
                <p>Here, writers actively insult, block, and doxx each other for the crime of disagreeing with an opinion, or providing criticism.</p>
                <p>For contemporary literature, which has been consistently outperformed by older titles, this aversion to criticism only serves to prolong the stagnation it is currently experiencing.</p>
                <p>If our stated mission is to find and promote the best voices of our generation--voices that have probably struggled to be heard for quite a while--then we won't find it there.</p>
                <p>Not because they're not there, but unless we engage in the same behavior, they won't find us.</p>
                <p>In fact, continuing to participate and engage in that environment will serve only to legitimize it.</p>
                <p>So, here we are.</p>
                <p>If you are one of these voices, we ask that you please head over to our website faunbymoonlight.com and send us your work. We would leave to hear from you.</p>
                <p>Despite good pre-order sales, and very healthy website visits, we are still quite new in this space.</p>
                <p>If you wish to support great literature, even just a follow and interaction goes a long way.</p>
                <p>Thank you, and remember: Be Unpublishable</p>
